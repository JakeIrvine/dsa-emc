1. i) Eve can send out a message from Alice by running the algorithm normally. Since Eve has the private key, and all parameters, she can sign her own messages with a valid Alice signature.
  ii) Message: Screw you alice!
      Signature: r = 809304215582509806415504184278247210482869715784
		 s = 648034331915913842536085741818387259052900662535

2. i) Eve could know if her value of x is correct by trying to sign a message then verifying the signature. If it verifies, her value of x is correct.
  ii) x = 0xbeef
 iii) Message : Hi, my name is Luc√≠a
signature = (r,s) = (501253276143788752446680418155799534842887411078, 490493288456700381214967074730069495319100320485)
